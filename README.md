## Evergreen Christmas Trees - Next.js

### The friendliest christmas tree farm in Melbourne's south east

A Next.js rebuilt of the Evergreen Christmas Trees repo

To do:
[ ] Add auth (passport?)
[ ] Add imported props to redux, to avoid extended prop drilling
[ ] Add CSSTransitions for React instead of fading with CSS
[ ] Look at nprogress library
[ ] Rewrite db connection so im not opening a new connection each time
