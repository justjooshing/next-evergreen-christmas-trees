## Evergreen Christmas Trees - Next.js

### The friendliest christmas tree farm in Melbourne's south east

A Next.js rebuilt of the Evergreen Christmas Trees repo

To do:
[ ] Add auth (passport?)
[ ] Add CSSTransitions for React instead of fading with CSS
[ ] Am I using SSR properly? Is all my content being generated intially? Do I need to add getstaticprops somewhere as well?
